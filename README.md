## SELLEX ##

This is an E-Commerce kind of web application, the main purpose of this application is to help college and school students. 
Following are the main features of this application:

1. User can post ad for Books, Laptop/Mobile , PG/Hostel and other stationery items.
2. User can update his/her existing ad.
3. User view other ads and get the product he/she is interested in buying.
4. They can also apply filters depending on different criterias.
5. Authentication facility is also provided.
6. User can add products in his/her wishlisht.

This application basically promotes the reusability. Students can reuse the books and other stationery materials. I have used XAMPP server with PHP backend along with Oracle SQL database with ODBC Driver. For front-end I have used HTML/CSS little bit of bootstrap, Javascript and Jquery.
